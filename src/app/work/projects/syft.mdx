## Overview

Syft (now Indeed Flex) is a staffing platform that connects workers with flexible job opportunities. Joined as one of the first engineers and helped build the platform from the ground up through acquisition by Indeed in 2019.

## My Role

As a founding engineer, I was involved in every aspect of building the platform:

- **Architecture**: Designed core systems that scaled from zero to millions of users
- **Product Development**: Built features across the entire stack
- **Process**: Established engineering practices and workflows
- **Mentoring**: Helped grow the engineering team
- **Production**: Handled incidents and kept the platform running

## Key Contributions

- Wrote 20% of the codebase before acquisition
- Scaled the platform through rapid growth phase
- Helped prepare systems for acquisition due diligence
- Transitioned smoothly to Indeed post-acquisition

## Impact

The platform has helped millions of people find flexible work opportunities. The successful acquisition by Indeed validated the technology and team we built.

## Learnings

- How to build systems that scale from startup to enterprise
- The importance of clean code and technical debt management
- Balancing speed with quality in a high-growth environment
- Working effectively through an acquisition

## After Acquisition

Continued at Indeed as Senior Software Engineer, leading development of Flex Levels and mentoring junior engineers.
