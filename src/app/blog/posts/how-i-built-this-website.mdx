## The Challenge

I needed a personal portfolio website but didn't want to spend days designing and coding it from scratch. I wanted something that looked professional, was easy to maintain, and showcased my work effectively.

## The Solution: One Prompt

I used Claude (with Claude Code) and a single prompt to generate my entire portfolio. Here's the exact prompt I used:

```
I want you to create me my personal website/portfolio.

As a base use this template:
git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio.git

For data (skills, experience, projects) go to:
- My GitHub: <YOUR_GITHUB_URL>
- My LinkedIn profile (in the attached PDF file)
- My recent projects from: <YOUR_COMPANY_OR_PROJECTS_URL>

Make project deployable to Vercel
```

That's it. Claude handled:
- Cloning and setting up the template
- Extracting my work history from LinkedIn
- Pulling project information from my company website
- Configuring all the content files
- Setting up Vercel deployment

## The Stack

The website is built with:
- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **Once UI** - Design system for consistent styling
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX for blog posts and project pages
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting

## Try It Yourself

1. Have your LinkedIn profile exported as PDF
2. Gather links to your GitHub and any project showcases
3. Use the prompt above with Claude Code
4. Deploy to Vercel

The entire process took about 30 minutes, most of which was Claude reading my profiles and generating content.

## What I Customized After

After the initial generation, I made a few tweaks:
- Added custom project screenshots
- Fine-tuned some of the copy
- Added this blog post

The magic portfolio template from Once UI made it easy to customize further through simple TypeScript configuration files.
